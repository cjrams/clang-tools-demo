# Clang-Format sample

Run the script `clang-format -style=llvm -i reverse.cpp` and see how reverse.cpp is coverted into reserve.llvm.cpp, also experiemnt with other formats like google, to see the diferences.

Run the second sample `clang-format -style=file -i configurator.cpp` to experiemtn with simple `.clang-file` configuration.

Files with actual results are also in the repo, as samples. Also original version copy.
