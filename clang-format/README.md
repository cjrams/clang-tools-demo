# Clang-Format sample

Run the script `clang-format -style=llvm -i reverse.cpp` and see how reverse.cpp is converted into reserve.llvm.cpp, also experiment with other formats like google, to see the differences.

Run the second sample `clang-format -style=file -i configurator.cpp` to experiment with simple `.clang-file` configuration.

Files with actual results are also in the repository, as samples. Also original version copy.

Original files for samples:

 * [reverse.cpp](https://es.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse)
 * [configurator.cpp](https://zed0.co.uk/clang-format-configurator/)
